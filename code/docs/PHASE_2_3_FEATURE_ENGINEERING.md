```python
# Single text analysis
result = analyzer.analyze_single_text(text, source="reuters")

# Batch analysis
results = await analyzer.analyze_batch(news_data)

# Market aggregation
market_sentiment = analyzer.aggregate_market_sentiment(results)

# Signal generation
signals = analyzer.generate_sentiment_signals(market_sentiment)
```

**Educational Value**: Explains how market emotions create trading opportunities and risks.

### 3. Market Microstructure Module (`market_microstructure.py`)

- **Market Regime Detection**: High volatility, low liquidity, pressure states

**Key Methods**:
```python
# Update with market data
analyzer.update_order_book(market_depth)
analyzer.add_trade(trade_data)

# Calculate features
features = analyzer.calculate_all_features(symbol)

# Estimate slippage
slippage = analyzer.estimate_slippage(symbol, order_size, side)

# Detect market regime
regime = analyzer.get_market_regime(symbol)
```

**Educational Value**: Teaches how order flow reveals institutional activity and market intentions.

### 4. Feature Pipeline Module (`feature_pipeline.py`)

**Educational Focus**: The pipeline orchestrates all feature generation, ensuring consistency, proper timing, and quality control.

**Features Implemented**:

    symbol="AAPL",
    market_data=price_data,
    news_data=news_data
)

# Export for model training
df = pipeline.export_features("AAPL", format='dataframe')

# Feature statistics
stats = pipeline.get_feature_statistics()
```
