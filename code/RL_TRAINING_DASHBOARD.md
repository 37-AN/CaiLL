## 🧠 RL Concepts Explained

### What You're Monitoring

**Episodes**: Complete trading sessions from start to finish
- Each episode = one full market simulation
- Agents learn from thousands of episodes

**Rewards**: How well the agent performed
- Positive reward = profitable trades
- Negative reward = losses
- Agents optimize for maximum cumulative reward

**Win Rate**: % of profitable trades
- Higher is better
- 50%+ is profitable (with proper risk management)

**Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted returns
- Measures return per unit of risk
- >1.0 is good, >1.5 is excellent

**Exploration Rate**: How often agent tries new strategies
- Starts high (explore new actions)
- Decreases over time (exploit learned strategies)
- Epsilon-greedy strategy balances both

**Training Loss**: How wrong the agent's predictions are
- Decreases as agent learns
- Convergence indicates learning completion

## 🔄 Training Process

### How Agents Learn

1. **Experience Collection**
   - Agent trades in simulated market
   - Stores (state, action, reward, next_state) in buffer
   - Builds experience library

2. **Learning from Experience**
   - Samples random batches from buffer
   - Updates neural network weights
   - Improves action selection policy

3. **Policy Improvement**
   - Tests new policy in environment
   - Measures performance (rewards)
   - Iteratively refines strategy

4. **Convergence**
   - Performance plateaus
   - Agent reaches optimal strategy
   - Deployed for live trading

### Multi-Agent System

**Why 4 Different Agents?**
- Different market conditions favor different strategies
- **Trend Agent**: Bull/bear markets
- **Mean Reversion**: Range-bound markets
- **Volatility Agent**: High volatility periods
- **Momentum Agent**: Strong directional moves

**Ensemble Approach**:
- Agents vote on trading decisions
- Diversification reduces risk
- Adapts to changing market regimes

## 📊 What Backend Will Provide

When Python backend connects, this tab will show **LIVE DATA**:

### Real-time Updates
- ✅ Actual training progress from running agents
- ✅ Live reward updates every episode
- ✅ Real neural network loss metrics
- ✅ Current hyperparameter values
- ✅ Actual buffer utilization

### Historical Charts
- Reward curves over time
- Loss convergence graphs
- Win rate progression
- Performance by market regime

### Training Controls
- Start/stop training
- Adjust learning rates
- Export model checkpoints
- Load previous versions

## 🎯 Using This Dashboard

### Monitor Learning Progress
1. Check system-wide metrics for overall health
2. Review individual agent cards for detailed performance
3. Watch progress bars to track completion
4. Look for trend arrows indicating improvement

### Identify Issues
- **Flat rewards**: Agent not learning → adjust hyperparameters
- **High loss**: Poor predictions → increase training episodes
- **Low win rate**: Strategy not profitable → review reward function
- **Buffer full**: Need to increase capacity or prune old samples

### Optimize Training
- **Compare agents**: See which algorithm works best
- **A/B testing**: Try different hyperparameters
- **Early stopping**: Pause converged agents
- **Model selection**: Export and deploy best performers

## 🚀 Next Steps

### When Backend Connects
The RL Training tab will automatically:
1. Connect via WebSocket
2. Stream live training metrics
3. Update agent statuses in real-time
4. Show actual neural network training
5. Display real reward curves

### To Start Training
```bash
# Fix Python backend imports (main blocker)
# Then start backend:
python backend/main.py
```

The backend will:
- Initialize RL agents
- Start training episodes
- Send metrics to frontend
- Update dashboard in real-time
