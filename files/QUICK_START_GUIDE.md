# Quick Start Guide - AI Trading System

## What You've Got

You now have a **complete, step-by-step prompt** that will guide an AI assistant (Claude or similar) to build you a production-ready AI trading system from scratch.

## What the System Will Do

Your finished system will:

✅ **Trade Multiple Assets:** Stocks, options, and cryptocurrency  
✅ **Learn Continuously:** Uses reinforcement learning that improves over time  
✅ **Store Everything:** Vector database for fast pattern recognition  
✅ **Teach You:** Interactive educational modules on trading and algorithms  
✅ **Manage Risk:** Multiple safety layers and risk controls
